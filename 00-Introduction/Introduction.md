# Introduction

- We have divided this book into three parts. The first several chapters describe the principles,
  patterns, and practices of writing clean code. There is quite a bit of code in these
  chapters, and they will be challenging to read. They’ll prepare you for the second section
  to come. If you put the book down after reading the first section, good luck to you!

- The second part of the book is the harder work. It consists of several case studies of
  ever-increasing complexity. Each case study is an exercise in cleaning up some code—of
  transforming code that has some problems into code that has fewer problems. The detail in
  this section is intense. You will have to flip back and forth between the narrative and the
  code listings. You will have to analyze and understand the code we are working with and
  walk through our reasoning for making each change we make. Set aside some time
  because this should take you days.
- The third part of this book is the payoff. It is a single chapter containing a list of heuristics
  and smells gathered while creating the case studies. As we walked through and
  cleaned up the code in the case studies, we documented every reason for our actions as a
  heuristic or smell. We tried to understand our own reactions to the code we were reading
  and changing, and worked hard to capture why we felt what we felt and did what we did.
  The result is a knowledge base that desribes the way we think when we write, read, and
  clean code.
